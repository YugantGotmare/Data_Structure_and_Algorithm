# There are two type of Sorting Algorithm

    1) Comparison Based
        eg Selection Sort
        Bubble sort, Insertion sort
        MergeSort, Quicksort,  <--- Divide and conqure application
        Heap sort
    2) Non-Comparison based
        eg Count sort, radix sort
           Bucket sort



Stable vs unstable sorting Algorithm
Stable --> relative order should be maintained after sorting Algorithm
unstable --> Quicksort, Selection sort, Heap sort
eg:
    [4a,5,7,3,4b,6,10]
    stable --> [3,a,4b,5,6,7,10]
    unstable --> [3,4b,4a,5,6,7,10]



Inplace & Outplace Sorting Algorithm
Inplace --> Not using  any extra space to sort an array 
Outplace --> using  any extra space to sort an array 
            eg: MergeSort ( Most optimize sorting Algorithm)
